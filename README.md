💪🔥 We Built a Fitness Calorie Counter – Introducing RNH Fuel!

Proud to share our web project RNH Fuel, a calorie counter made for anyone who wants to monitor their diet and fitness goals.
I focused on the JavaScript functionality — making the app dynamic, responsive, and interactive.

👥 Team Contributions:
🧠 Navadeep (me) – Wrote the JavaScript logic (slide navigation, BMI, food feedback)
🎨 Rishith – Designed the entire frontend using HTML & CSS
👨‍💻 Hariteja – Created the core logic and handled food data with Python

🧩 Key Features:
✅ Login validation
✅ Auto DOB to Age
✅ BMI Calculation
✅ Food input with real-time tracking
✅ Goal feedback (Bulk/Cut)
✅ Fully responsive
✅ No backend – lightweight & browser-based
✅ Hosted on GitHub Pages

🧠 Why This Matters:
It’s simple, smart, and tailored for Indian meals – perfect for anyone managing fitness goals.
Massive thanks to my team – we learned a lot and had fun building it!
